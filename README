== Preface ==
A lot of web sites, even well known ones (newspapers, telcos, ...) adopts 
WordPress as their CMS. WordPress is a great platform, however it
can happen that password leaking or guessing might lead to unauthorized
access to the platform. A potential attacker can be therefore able to 
change articles, part of the web site and/or make the website unavailable,
with image and economic damages for a company or for a blogger.

SecurePass is a SaaS service offering an easy and affordable solution
for strong authentication. They offer 5 users for free included with their
standard (=basic) account, which is more than enough for standard blogs and
web sites. Companies can increase users, if needed.

== Setup and configure SecurePass ==
If you donâ€™t own already an account with SecurePass, you can sign-up for a new account here: http://www.secure-pass.net/open

Note: Use "misec2011" as promo code, it will give you an entitlement for using 
SecurePass up to 10 users for 2 years free-of-charge. Without any promo code,
you will have 5 users for 20 years for free. It depends on what you need (more users or more years).

Connect to the admin interface on https://admin.secure-pass.net 
and create a new device (basically a RADIUS client). 

In the admin interface, go to the "Device" section and add a new device. 
You will need to set the public IP Address of the server, a fully qualified 
domain name (FQDN), and the secret password for the radius authentication. 
It's ok if your web server is behind a firewall and/or NAT, ensure that
your server has rights to send (and receive) RADIUS authentication requests,
i.e. UDP port 1812.

== Setup and configure the WordPress Plugin ==
Simply copy this software's directory in the following WordPress location:
wp-content/plugins/

Edit the securepass.php file and change $radius_secret variable to reflect
the secret password as specified in the "Device" specified in the SecurePass
administration panel. The variable $radius_host contains the primary
RADIUS server of SecurePass, located in Switzerland (Lugano). 
A secondary RADIUS is available in Italy (Milan), if you prefer this
location change $radius_host to 'radius2.secure-pass.net'.

WARNING!!! Before going to the next step, create an user in wordpress that
matches a username in SecurePass and grant full administrative powers.
This because the admin user will be no longer checked locally. In case you 
won't be able to login anymore, a workaround is moving the securepass plugin 
directory to another directory name, ex: "mv securepass securepass.old".

Go to your WordPress configuration panel, select Plugins and activate the
"SecurePass authentication" plugin.
